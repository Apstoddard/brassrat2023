                        The most prominent face of the ring, the bezel of the Brass Rat sits at the very top of the ring and 
                        holds the very mascot that gives the ring its name: the beaver. A symbol chosen for MIT because of 
                        its engineering skill, the beaver has graced the Brass Rat since the first ring was delivered close 
                        to a century ago. This year, the bezel carries on many of the traditional elements of the ring that 
                        can be traced to generations of rings before ours, including the Harvard Bridge, the Charles River, 
                        Smoot markings, and other Boston and Cambridge landmarks that we know and love. 
                        <br><br>
                        However, our bezel stands out as the first of its kind to have a reflective design component in the 
                        Charles River, as well as to include both the Zakim and Longfellow Bridges. The design seeks to 
                        acknowledge all the beautiful memories we made on campus and the creative ways in which we came 
                        together as a class in the face of these uncertain times.

                        In the background of the Class Shank is the iconic view of the Great Dome. The infinite corridor, a 
                        hallway students walk down daily, is honored via an infinity sign at its top. On either side of 
                        the dome, two olive trees stand tall, showcasing the passage of time through the changing 
                        seasons. Mighty Kerberos, the hound of Hades, the namesake of our unique MIT emails, sits at 
                        the base of the dome guarding the gates of the Underworld (also known as lobby 10). The 
                        three-headed dog is symbolic of our class&apos;s spirit of collaboration, grit, and unity as we 
                        pursue our individual interests and passions in addition to the institute being a throughline 
                        in our lives. Athena lays her hand atop Kerberos&apos; head, guiding the hound and MIT students 
                        in the pursuit of knowledge. An expression of determination graces Athena&apos;s visage, mirroring 
                        our class&apos;s determination as we overcome challenge. At the base of the shank flies her trusty 
                        owl whose wings frame a globe representing the varied origins of our student body.

                        Rooting from the original MIT seal, the Class of 2023 Seal Shank is reimagined with a female on 
                        the left holding a hammer representing MIT and its students&apos; commitments to hands-on learning 
                        experience. It also includes a male holding a book, symbolizing wisdom. He dresses in a lab coat, representing 
                        the significance of laboratories both at MIT and around the globe. Between the two figures, the 
                        flame of the lamp spells &quot;23&quot;, signifying our class year, held up by a ribbon bearing MIT&apos;s 
                        motto &quot;Men et Manus&quot;.

                        the Kresge Auditorium, a place that marks our first gathering as a class and symbolizes MIT&apos;s 
                        creative livelihood. The seal design sits on a handshake between a human hand and one imprinted 
                        with patterns resembling the Alchemist statue, symbolizing our day-to-day collaboration with 
                        knowledge, technology, and each other in the MIT community.

                        The Boston Skyline faces the wearer until they graduate. This is representative of the view 
                        students see while they are living on campus at MIT. During graduation, everyone flips their 
                        ring around, with the Cambridge Skyline now facing the wearer. The Boston Skyline features 
                        a revolving collection of the city&apos;s unique yet beloved architecture. All of the included 
                        landmarks are portrayed under the night sky, a sight quite familiar to the nocturnal MIT 
                        student. Our version of the skyline depicts the order of our most-loved Boston landmarks as 
                        they would be seen from Killian Court on the MIT campus. The far left side begins with the 
                        Zakim Bridge. Then, a series of historical and modern Boston icons appear to the right of the 
                        bridge. These serve as a reminder of the dynamic tapestry that surrounds us. Finally, Mass 
                        Ave, a representation of the vein that keeps Boston and Cambridge connected, stretches 
                        along the Harvard Bridge beneath the Boston Skyline.

                        The Cambridge Skyline faces the wearer after graduation. The skyline features MIT&apos;s most prominent 
                        buildings during the day and spaces special to the Class of 2023. Mass Ave and the Harvard Bridge 
                        cut through the skyline, serving as the metaphorical barrier between work and play (or punt and 
                        tool in MIT lingo). The Stata Center and the Green Building serve to recognize the diversity of 
                        MIT&apos;s unique campus architecture. MIT&apos;s large athletics presence is symbolized by a pair of crew 
                        boats grouped into a &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;. An axis in the i-hat direction is sandwiched between the skyline 
                        and the river, depicted by an i-hat vector on the right of the skyline illustrating the physical 
                        space between us. While our class may have been spread apart around the world, the shared bonds 
                        we have formed together are what shape our MIT experience.

                        The Hacker&apos;s Map is the simplest element on the Brass Rat, yet it represents a longstanding part of 
                        MIT&apos;s culture and tradition. It lies hidden under the bezel, just as the tunnels hide underneath 
                        MIT&apos;s main buildings, out of sight for the common visitor. For many MIT students though, these 
                        tunnels play a large role in their daily lives, by providing a quick route that avoids the dense 
                        hallway crowds or even by literally acting as a canvas for artists to express themselves through 
                        murals. Most importantly, the map pays homage to the long and rich MIT tradition of hacking, and 
                        it guides the way for any who dare to hack. The Hacker&apos;s Map embodies the creativity and ingenuity 
                        that the MIT hacker community is so well known for. Our version of the map was designed with an 
                        unprecedented amount of dimensional accuracy to give MIT hackers the most precise way to navigate 
                        the tunnels.
